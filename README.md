#### Project Description
###### This project involves implementing kernels (in C and in x86-64 assembly) capable of performing the SAXPY (A*X + Y) function. The kernel must utilize functional scalar SIMD registers and floating-point instructions. The output of the kernel should display the result of the first ten elements of vector Z for both versions of the kernel (C and x86-64 assembly).
